- transcription: Transcription of what the user said in the recorded audio
- uact : The true user act
- turnnum : The index of the userturn in the dialogue, starting at 1. This is not used for any models described in the paper.
- lastsys : The previous system act
- asrhyps : the top 10 asr hypotheses. The p attribute is a posterior log probability. Note these aren't listed in rank order.
- rec : details about the recording. fname is important for working out what confusion network file to look up.

The computed confusion network features are found in the ./cnets folder.  E.g. the one for the above datum is at cnets/ky219x-001-111018_235207_0001085_0001609.rec 

The format of the file is a sparse vector, with the index of the non-zero component coming before a colon (':'), and the value after, followed by a new line.  Following the line #value_mapping# is a map which takes database tags to their values. E.g.:
#value_mapping#
food+value+0 -> chinese
means that the n-grams containing "food+value+0" originally contained the word "chinese".

The indices correspond to n-grams for n up to 3. These are stored in ngrams.txt in the following format:

n-gram ~ index ~ count in corpus_traindev.xml

E.g.:

price range a ~ 761 ~ 27
price range ah ~ 762 ~ 26
range of are ~ 763 ~ 3
the restaurant is ~ 764 ~ 24
of of ~ 765 ~ 91
what is a ~ 766 ~ 82
price range all ~ 767 ~ 2

The counts are not used in any model described in the paper, but were used in experiments using tf-idf to weight features for non-linear SVM kernels and other models.

Indices up to and including 509 correspond to the last system act features described in the paper. These start with the letters 'sys'.
